    <h1>Journal Entry: Uploading Brains</h1>
    <p>I recently came across the concept of uploading brains, inspired by the series "Pantheon." The idea revolves around humans being able to live in a virtually simulated environment by uploading their brains. This involves mapping the neural connections made by the brain using high-tech lasers and capturing every layer of the brain to its micrometer precision.</p>

    <h2>Successfully Uploaded Brains</h2>
    <p>Scientists have successfully uploaded the following brains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brain of Nematode Worm</strong> - Scientific Name: <em>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Brain of a Fruit Fly</strong> - Scientific Name: <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></li>
    </ul>
</body>
