# Journal Entry: Uploading Brains

I recently came across the concept of uploading brains, inspired by the series "Pantheon." The idea revolves around humans being able to live in a virtually simulated environment by uploading their brains. This involves mapping the neural connections made by the brain using high-tech lasers and capturing every layer of the brain to its micrometer precision.

## Successfully Uploaded Brains

Scientists have successfully uploaded the following brains:

- **Brain of Nematode Worm** - Scientific Name: *Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)*
