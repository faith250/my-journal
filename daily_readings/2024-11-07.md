## Introduction to Quantitative Structure-Odor Relationship (QSOR) Modeling

The ability to "smell" with AI opens up possibilities for **synthetic scent manufacturing**. This concept, known as **Quantitative Structure-Odor Relationship (QSOR)** modeling, holds potential for future applications, such as:

- **Generating new smells** similar to how AI generates images and sounds
- **Storing memorable scents** from loved ones, places, or environments that fade over time

## Process of Extracting and Mapping Smell

The process of converting a scent into data involves:

1. **Extracting the scent**: For example, squashing a plum and storing it in a vial.
2. **Capturing the air**: Sucking the air from the vial to trap the molecules that produce the smell, essentially turning air into data.
3. **Molecular Analysis**: Analyzing the molecules one by one to create a specific formula.
4. **Reprinting the smell**: Using the data to recreate the molecules that produce the original scent.

## How Odor Perception Works

Odor perception is a result of activating **400 different types of olfactory receptors**. These receptors are expressed in around **1 million olfactory sensory neurons** within a small patch of tissue, known as the **olfactory epithelium**. The olfactory signals are then sent to the **olfactory bulb**, where they are further processed by structures in the brain.

## Machine Learning and Odor Prediction

The task of predicting scent involves:

- **Simple molecules**, such as vanillin, which can be described with terms like **sweet, vanilla, creamy, and chocolate**. These descriptions make odor prediction a **multilabel classification problem**.
- **Proposed Network**: **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** are used to capture meaningful relationships between molecular structure and odor. GNNs are effective for this task as they:
  - Operate on graph structures (where molecules can be represented as graphs with edges and vertices).
  - Directly predict odor descriptions for individual molecules without relying on handcrafted rules.
