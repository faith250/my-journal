## Introduction
Learning by coding and questioning.

### Topics

- **Circadian Clock**
  - How does each individual cell in your body know what time it is?
  - Is there a clock gene?
  - What genes disrupt the clock and cause sleep disorders?
  - How can we locate the sleep and wake cycle messages within the long nucleotide sequences of a genome?

## DNA Basics

### Pairing and Structure

- **Base Pairs**:
  - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T).
  - Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G).
  - This pairing resembles protein structures and helps form the double-helix shape of DNA.

### Genome Replication

- **Cell Division and DNA Replication**:
  - Before cell division (referencing **mitosis** and **meiosis**), DNA must replicate.
  - Replication begins in a specific genomic region called the **replication origin** (ori).
  - The process is carried out by **DNA polymerases**, enzymes that create molecular copies of DNA.

- **Significance of the Replication Origin (ori)**:
  - Locating the ori is crucial for understanding DNA replication.
  - It's also significant in biomedical applications, where errors in replication can lead to disease.

### Gene Therapy and Genetic Engineering

- **Viral Vectors**:
  - In **gene therapy**, genetically engineered mini-genomes, called "viral vectors," are used to carry artificial genes.
  - Viral vectors are commonly used in agriculture and can penetrate cells similarly to viruses, allowing them to deliver genes that may treat or prevent disease.
